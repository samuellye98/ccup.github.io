#Modal-1,Modal-1,Modal-label-1,Pogo,"The Pogo robot is bouncing robot that is created around the mechanics of a reaction wheel. This reaction wheel allows it to shift its orientation in mid air, and allows us to keep it up right and control which direction to go towards. We decided on this project because it proposed interesting problems in all of the Mechanical, Electrical, Software, and Systems Engineering fields and requires a good deal of interdisciplinary work that we promote at Cornell Cup. For this semester, we aim to create a 2D version of Pogo that leans on an inclined wall, so that it can only bounce in a plane. Moving forwards, we look to create a full 3D version that can follow you around the lab.",pogo.JPG,2017 - 2018
#Modal-2,Modal-2,Modal-label-2,Interactive Wall,"The Interactive Wall is a wall designed to teach young students how to code. It uses physical blocks with code snippets that are then translated into physical movements of a robot. Players can start with basic maze games and advance to challenging levels with moving opponents, using their coding concepts and logic. The Wall can control both the 2D system and the MiniBot. The team is also working on 4D features that can enhance this fun but also educational experience.",wall.JPG,2017 - 2018
#Modal-3,Modal-3,Modal-label-3,MagGame,"MagGame was a project to create a physical game board that mirrors the digital realm of turn-based strategy games (ex. Fire Emblem). The intent was to bridge the digital and physical world and feature a manageable framework within an entertaining game that could be used out of the box for youths and expandable to extensive tabletop miniature model games (e.g., Warhammer 40,000). Basing the framework around a game, users would be able to derive entertainment, while exposing themselves to the challenges of “modding” a game and later developing and possibly programming a game.",chess.jpg,2017 - 2018
#Modal-4,Modal-4,Modal-label-4,Drummer,"As a secondary project for the Cornell Cup event, our design team was tasked with creating some kind of robotics display to entertain the audience and add an engineering twist to the already innovative exposition venue of Disney World. Taking input from Dr. Schneider, our project members, and the sponsors at Intel, we chose to focus our efforts on creating a “live” demonstration of the popular Xbox game “Rock Band 3”. It was decided that the scope for implementing this solution would include electronically beating the game, as well as physically representing the “band” through the creation of humanoid robots.",drummer.JPG,2011 - 2012
