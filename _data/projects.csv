#Modal-1,Modal-1,Modal-label-1,Pogo,"The Pogo robot is bouncing robot that is created around the mechanics of a reaction wheel. This reaction wheel allows it to shift its orientation in mid air, and allows us to keep it up right and control which direction to go towards. We decided on this project because it proposed interesting problems in all of the Mechanical, Electrical, Software, and Systems Engineering fields and requires a good deal of interdisciplinary work that we promote at Cornell Cup. For this semester, we aim to create a 2D version of Pogo that leans on an inclined wall, so that it can only bounce in a plane. Moving forwards, we look to create a full 3D version that can follow you around the lab.",pogo.jpg,2017 - 2018
#Modal-2,Modal-2,Modal-label-2,Interactive Wall,"The Interactive Wall is a wall designed to teach young students how to code. It uses physical blocks with code snippets that are then translated into physical movements of a robot. Players can start with basic maze games and advance to challenging levels with moving opponents, using their coding concepts and logic. The Wall can control both the 2D system and the MiniBot. The team is also working on 4D features that can enhance this fun but also educational experience.",wall.jpg,2017 - 2018
#Modal-3,Modal-3,Modal-label-3,MagGame,"MagGame was a project to create a physical game board that mirrors the digital realm of turn-based strategy games (ex. Fire Emblem). The intent was to bridge the digital and physical world and feature a manageable framework within an entertaining game that could be used out of the box for youths and expandable to extensive tabletop miniature model games (e.g., Warhammer 40,000). Basing the framework around a game, users would be able to derive entertainment, while exposing themselves to the challenges of “modding” a game and later developing and possibly programming a game.",chess.jpg,2017 - 2018
#Modal-4,Modal-4,Modal-label-4,Modbot V2,"ModBot V2 was a modular robotics platform that was capable of autonomous and manual user controlled operation. The system was able to support a wide range of modular attachments including everything from simple low level sensors to complex solutions such as a robotic arm.  

ModBot V2 was a revision to ModBot V1, which was integrated without careful allocation of components, though it was able to complete its task. ModBot V2 placed an emphasis on good engineering design by considering modularity, usability, manufacturability, ease of assembly, and maintainability. A systems engineering approach was taken at all steps in the engineering process. ",,2015 - 2016

#Modal-7,Modal-7,Modal-label-7,Rock Band,"As a secondary project for the Cornell Cup event, our design team was tasked with creating some kind of robotics display to entertain the audience and add an engineering twist to the already innovative exposition venue of Disney World. Taking input from Dr. Schneider, our project members, and the sponsors at Intel, we chose to focus our efforts on creating a “live” demonstration of the popular Xbox game “Rock Band 3”. It was decided that the scope for implementing this solution would include electronically beating the game, as well as physically representing the “band” through the creation of humanoid robots.",rockband.png,2012 - 2013
#Modal-8,Modal-8,Modal-label-8,Dunebot,"The DuneBot was the team's research and development project for 2012-2013, focusing particualrly on electronic outdoor systems. The DuneBot was an interactive Dune Buggy vehicle with a laser tag firing mechanism that could be driven and made to fire using an Xbox controller! It could nteract and play laser tag with other DuneBots or even with humans! By providing live camera feed at over 20 frames/second, a human could play a live laser tag video game within the wireless range.

Conquering the outdoor terrain and unpredictable weather were the two main objectives for DuneBot. It was designed to be able to drive over rough, inclined and outdoor surfaces, maintain constant velocity while climbing a gradient, withstand inclement weather, and included a robust cooling system for the outdoors; all while maintaining the modularity of previous Minibots.

#Modal-9,Modal-9,Modal-label-9,Modbot V1,"In previous years, the Intel-Cornell Cup team focused on developing a modular robotics platform. The goal of the project was to serve as a foundation for more advanced robotics projects with minimum restrictions on creativity or design for potential users. The primary goal was to provide a means to “easily power a device, from a sensor to a servo mechanism, and interface it to the Intel Atom board without having to deal with low level communication and circuit design”. In short, we wanted to create a mobile platform with high processing capabilities that users could create advanced projects within a simple “plug and play” environment without worrying about the lower-level power or interface details. As a result, the ModBot V1 was born. This culminated in a system that was able to power a robotic Rock Band.",modbot1.png,2011 - 2012
