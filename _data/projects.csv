#Modal-1,Modal-1,Modal-label-1,Pogo,past,"The Pogo robot is bouncing robot that is created around the mechanics of a reaction wheel. This reaction wheel allows it to shift its orientation in mid air, and allows us to keep it up right and control which direction to go towards. We decided on this project because it proposed interesting problems in all of the Mechanical, Electrical, Software, and Systems Engineering fields and requires a good deal of interdisciplinary work that we promote at Cornell Cup. For this semester, we aim to create a 2D version of Pogo that leans on an inclined wall, so that it can only bounce in a plane. Moving forwards, we look to create a full 3D version that can follow you around the lab.",pogo.JPG
#Modal-2,Modal-2,Modal-label-2,Interactive Wall,past,"The Interactive Wall is a wall designed to teach young students how to code. It uses physical blocks with code snippets that are then translated into physical movements of a robot. Players can start with basic maze games and advance to challenging levels with moving opponents, using their coding concepts and logic. The Wall can control both the 2D system and the MiniBot. The team is also working on 4D features that can enhance this fun but also educational experience.",wall.png

#Modal-4,Modal-4,Modal-label-4,Minibot/Buddybot,current,"The MiniBot project aims to create a cost effective and intuitive learning platform for undergraduate and high school students to learn about the basics of robotics. The MiniBot is modular and easy to assemble so students can create anything from line followers and sumo bots to race cars with the system. The base will be compatible with both Vex and Lego pieces and will include custom electronics and modular assembly pieces. Additionally, there will be a simple user interface with a coding platform where student can quickly upload commands and code to the robot. Students will be able to do everything for the robotic design including electronics, assembly, and the coding commands.",minibot.jpg
